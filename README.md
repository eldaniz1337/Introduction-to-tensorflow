# Introduction To Tensorflow for Deep Learning

I used cat and dog image dataset for creating Convolutional Neural Network. I leave link of the dataset here, due to size of dataset, I cannot attach to the repo.

There are 2 zip files in this dataset, test1.zip is for testing and train.zip is for training the model.
